Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files in a project over time. It typically records what the changes were (what was added? what was removed from the file?), who made the changes, notes and comments about the changes by the changer, and at what time the changes were made. GitHub is a web hosting service for the source code of software and web development projects (or other text based projects) that use Git. GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted for free through GitHub. GitHub users can create and host both personal websites (one allowed per user) and websites related to specific GitHub projects.

Jekyll is a very powerful static site generator. In some senses, it is a throwback to the days of static HTML before databases were used to store website content. For simple sites without complex architectures, like a personal website, this is a huge plus. When used alongside GitHub, Jekyll will automatically re-generate all the HTML pages for your website each time you commit a file.

Whenever you commit to this repository in GitHub, GitHub Pages will run Jekyll to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files. You can use the editor on GitHub to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. Keep [this page open} (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to help you as you write, edit, and revise.
